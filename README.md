### Shell Script Collection

Welcome to my collection of random yet handy shell scripts! This repository contains a variety of scripts that Iâ€™ve created to automate tasks, play around with the command line.

### Usage

To use any of these scripts, clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run. Make sure the script has executable permissions, then run it from the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nahK994/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
```

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful script or an improvement to one of the existing ones, feel free to open a pull request. Let's build a robust collection of shell scripts together.
